My Vercel build logs show this warning/error:

A PostCSS plugin did not pass the `from` option to `postcss.parse`.  
This may cause imported assets to be incorrectly transformed.  
If you've recently added a PostCSS plugin that raised this warning, please contact the package author to fix the issue.


I want you to fix this issue completely and ensure my site builds and styles correctly on Vercel.

Please follow these steps carefully:

üß© Step 1: Diagnose the Root Cause

Inspect my postcss.config.js, tailwind.config.js, and all CSS imports.

Identify if the warning is caused by:

An outdated or incompatible PostCSS plugin.

A missing from option in the PostCSS setup.

Incorrect import of CSS files or Tailwind layers.

Check that postcss, autoprefixer, and tailwindcss versions are compatible with my Next.js version.

Ensure postcss.config.js uses standard Tailwind setup like:

module.exports = {
  plugins: {
    tailwindcss: {},
    autoprefixer: {},
  },
}

üõ†Ô∏è Step 2: Apply Fixes

If postcss.config.js has unnecessary plugins, remove them.

Ensure the file includes only tailwindcss and autoprefixer.

Update packages:

npm install postcss@latest autoprefixer@latest tailwindcss@latest


Add this fallback to prevent the warning:

// postcss.config.js
const path = require('path');
module.exports = {
  from: path.resolve(__dirname, 'styles/globals.css'),
  plugins: {
    tailwindcss: {},
    autoprefixer: {},
  },
};


Verify that all CSS files imported in _app.tsx or _app.js use proper relative paths (e.g. import '../styles/globals.css';).

‚ö° Step 3: Test and Redeploy

Run locally:

npm run build
npm run start


Ensure no PostCSS warnings appear.

Once verified, redeploy to Vercel.

Confirm styles load correctly and the warning no longer appears in build logs.

‚úÖ Goal

Deliver a fully functional, warning-free Next.js + Tailwind + PostCSS build that deploys cleanly on Vercel, with all styling applied properly.

Output:

Fixed configuration for postcss.config.js.

Updated compatible package versions.

Verified successful build with no PostCSS warnings.
