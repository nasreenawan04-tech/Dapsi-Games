My website deployed on Vercel only shows a blank white screen, even though the build succeeds.
The project uses Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and Firebase (Auth + Firestore).

Please follow these steps carefully to diagnose and fix the problem:

üß© Step 1: Debug the Issue

Inspect all Vercel build logs and console errors in both build and runtime.

Check for:

Missing or invalid environment variables (Firebase config).

Errors in next.config.js, _app.tsx, or _document.tsx.

Components failing to render due to import or hook errors.

Any hydration mismatches between server and client.

Confirm that the root page (index.tsx or page.tsx) actually returns visible content.

Identify whether the issue occurs on server-side rendering or client-side mount.

üõ†Ô∏è Step 2: Fix the Root Cause

Based on findings from Step 1:

If environment variables are missing or undefined:

Verify .env.local and Vercel Environment Variables (Firebase API Key, Auth Domain, Project ID, etc.).

Ensure they are referenced correctly using process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_....

If there are runtime or import errors:

Fix incorrect imports, file paths, or component exports.

Remove unused or broken dependencies causing the build to hang.

If the app fails during rendering:

Add an ErrorBoundary or console logging inside _app.tsx to capture the actual error.

Ensure your index.tsx (home page) returns valid JSX ‚Äî not empty fragments.

Replace any client-only Firebase calls with useEffect to prevent SSR crashes.

If CSS or UI doesn‚Äôt render:

Confirm Tailwind CSS is correctly configured in postcss.config.js and globals.css.

‚ö° Step 3: Test & Redeploy

Run npm run build && npm run start locally to confirm the site renders before redeploying.

Once fixed, deploy again to Vercel.

Ensure there are no runtime errors in the browser console or Vercel logs.

‚úÖ Goal

Deliver a fully functional website that renders correctly after deployment (no blank screen).
Confirm that:

Home page loads visible content.

Firebase and Tailwind load correctly.

No console errors remain.

The Vercel site (https://dapsi-games-dlf5.vercel.app) displays all components as expected.
